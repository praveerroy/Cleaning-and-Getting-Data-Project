This is the CodeBook for the Project

run_analysis is the script that generates averages_data

The run_analysis.R does the following operations on the dataset:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

averages_data is also uploaded in this repository.

The variable discriptions for the project is as follows:

Variables• x_train ,  y_train ,  x_test ,  y_test ,  subject_train  and  subject_test  contain the data from the downloaded files.
• x_data ,  y_data  and  subject_data  merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
• features  contains the correct names for the  x_data  dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in  features_data , a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
•A similar approach is taken with activity names through the  activities  variable.
• all_data  merges  x_data ,  y_data  and  subject_data  in a big dataset.
•Finally,  averages_data  contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a  .txt  file.  ddply()  from the plyr package is used to apply  colMeans()  and ease the development.
